                    The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset offers a wonderfully diverse snapshot of our favorite companion
                    animals, featuring 25 dog breeds totaling 4,978 images and 12 cat breeds comprising 2,371 images.
                    This numerical imbalance (dogs outnumber cats by about 2:1) reflects the real-world reality that
                    there are more recognized dog breeds than cat breeds. Each individual breed is well-represented
                    with approximately 200 images per category (with just a few exceptions like the British Shorthair
                    at 184 and Staffordshire Bull Terrier at 189). While this dataset captures the wide variety of our
                    four-legged friends, it's worth noting that the dog/cat imbalance may cause our classification model
                    to perform slightly better with dogs than cats simply because more canine examples were seen during
                    training. Whether you have a tiny Chihuahua, a fluffy Persian, or a majestic Great Pyrenees, our pet
                    classification model has been trained to recognize your beloved companion!

                    The training dataset may contain some incorrectly labeled images, or label noise. Even experienced animal lovers and veterinarians
                    sometimes struggle to distinguish between visually similar breeds like Basset Hounds and Beagles (both with
                    droopy ears and similar coloration), British Shorthairs and Russian Blues (both blue-gray cats with similar body
                    types), or Ragdolls and Birmans (both with pointed coloration and semi-long fur). These challenging distinctions
                    can introduce incorrect labels in the training data that the model then learns and reproduces. When our model
                    occasionally mistakes one breed for a similar-looking breed, it may reflect these challenges for human experts.

    <h2>Bias Assessment</h2>

                    While our pet recognition model aims to accurately identify a wide variety of dog and cat breeds, there are
                    some important limitations to be aware of. The numerical imbalance in our dataset (4,978 dog images versus
                    2,371 cat images) may cause the model to perform better on dog recognition simply because it has seen more
                    canine examples during training. Similarly, breeds with distinctive features, like the wrinkly Shar-Pei or
                    hairless Sphynx cat, may be identified with greater accuracy than breeds sharing similar characteristics, such
                    as the various terrier breeds, which can sometimes be confused with one another. The dataset includes pets
                    photographed in various lighting conditions, backgrounds, and photo styles—from professional portraits to casual
                    snapshots—but in-focus images will produce the best results as this better reflects the training data. Color
                    patterns can also affect recognition—cats with tabby patterns might occasionally be misclassified among
                    similar-patterned breeds. Our model may struggle with mixed-breed pets, unusual angles, or pets wearing
                    accessories; providing clear, well-lit photos of your pet's face will help achieve the most accurate results.
